# Northwind Trading System

A modern web application built with Spring Boot (Java 21) backend and React frontend, based on the classic Northwind database.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Java 21** with Spring Boot 3.2.1
- **Gradle** build system
- **Spring Data JPA** for database operations
- **H2 Database** (in-memory for development)
- **PostgreSQL** support for production
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** for API documentation
- **MapStruct** for DTO mapping
- **JWT Authentication** ready

### Frontend (React)
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for UI components
- **MUI X Data Grid** for data tables
- **Axios** for API communication
- **Responsive design**

## üìä Database Schema

The system includes the following main entities:

- **Products**: Product catalog with categories and suppliers
- **Categories**: Product categorization
- **Suppliers**: Supplier information
- **Customers**: Customer data with party model
- **Employees**: Employee information with party model
- **Orders**: Customer orders with order details
- **Geographic**: Countries, regions, and cities hierarchy
- **Authentication**: User login and role management

See [ER-Diagram.md](./ER-Diagram.md) for detailed database schema visualization.
